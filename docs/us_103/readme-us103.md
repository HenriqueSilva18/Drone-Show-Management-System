# US 103 – Project Structure Setup

## 1. Context

This task is being implemented for the first time during **Sprint 1**. It is a foundational task to define and organize the project structure, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The goal is to prepare the system for upcoming user stories and simplify development across multiple modules.

## 2. Requirements

**US103** – As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate/accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- US103.1 - The project must follow a modular Maven architecture.
- US103.2 - Scripts and documentation should be clearly organized.

**Dependencies/References:**

- There is a dependency on US101 (non-functional requirements, constraints and concerns in section 5).
- There is a dependency on US102 (Project Repository) as the repository must be created.
