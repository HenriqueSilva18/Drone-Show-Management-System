# US101 - Technical constraints

## 1. Context

This task is being done for the first time in **Sprint 1**. It focuses on identifying and documenting all technical constraints from the project requirements. The goal is to make sure the team follows these rules during development to keep the system consistent and reliable.

## 2. Requirements

**US101** - As Project Manager, I want the team to follow the technical constraints and concerns of the project.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- US101.1 - All rules defined in Section 5 of the requirements document must be identified and documented by the team.

**Dependencies/References:**

- There is a dependency on Non-Functional Requirements (constraints and concerns in section 5).

## 3. Analysis

The team reviewed the project's constraints, identifying key non-functional requirements. These were documented to guide technical decisions throughout development.
