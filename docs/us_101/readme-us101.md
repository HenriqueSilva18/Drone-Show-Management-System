## 5. Implementation

The implementation of US101 involves:
- Read section 5 of the project document to identify all technical restrictions and non-functional requirements.
- Create a document that outlines the identified restrictions and rules.
- Review each user story to ensure compliance with the technical restrictions.
- Document technical decisions in the repository.
- Schedule a meeting with the team to discuss and validate the understanding of these restrictions.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

The technical constraints will be demonstrated through:
- The proper functioning of the GitHub repository
- The execution of CI/CD pipelines
- The ability to switch between in-memory and relational database configurations
- The presence and quality of documentation
- Authentication and authorization working as expected
