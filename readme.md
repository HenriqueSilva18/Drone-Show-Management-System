# Project Shodrone

## 1. Description of the Project

In the 2024-2025 academic year, the fourth semester of the Degree in
Informatics Engineering (LEI) of the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto
(ISEP) adopts a ProjectBased Learning (PBL) learning process based on the development of a single project integrating all
units of the semester: Applications Engineering (EAPLI), Laboratory and Project IV (LAPR4), Languages
and Programming (LPROG), Computer Networks (RCOMP) and Computer Systems(SCOMP).

The project, common to all course units, consists of developing the system
to a company Shodrone that is dedicated to providing customized drone multimedia shows. It has a library
of figures and sequences and allows clients to select sets of them for their personalized shows. It also
allows clients to submit proposals for new figures to be used in their super exclusive shows.
